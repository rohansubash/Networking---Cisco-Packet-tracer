ðŸ–§ Cisco Packet Tracer Labs

Welcome to my Cisco Packet Tracer repository, where I demonstrate hands-on networking simulations, device configurations, and protocol testing using one of the most widely used tools in the networking domain â€” Cisco Packet Tracer.

Repository Highlights:

1.Router & Switch Configuration (Static & Dynamic Routing, VLANs, Trunking, NAT, DHCP).

2.End-to-End Network Design for LAN, WAN, and hybrid topologies.

3.Routing Protocols Implementation (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP).

4.Network Simulation & Testing (Ping, Traceroute, ARP, DNS).

5.Security Features Setup (Access Control Lists, Password Protection, SSH).

6.Performance Optimization with subnetting and address planning.
